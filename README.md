# mac-bash-theme
This repository includes config files and a terminal theme to make your Mac terminal look like Git Bash on Windows. To use this, import the Git Bash.terminal profile using Terminal and set it as the default. Then, copy the .bash_profile and .gitconfig files (or the contents to your existing files) to your Home directory.
* Git Bash.terminal - Mac terminal theme that changes the background and text colors.
* .bash_profile - Changes the bash prompt to display the Git branch you are currently in.
* .gitconfig - Changes some of the colors displayed when using Git commands.
