# mac-bash-theme
This repository includes config files and a terminal theme to make your Mac terminal look like Git Bash on Windows. To use this, import the Git Bash.terminal file using Terminal and then copy the contents of .bash_profile and .gitconfig to your Home directory (e.g. ~/Users/rvogel).
* Git Bash.terminal - Mac terminal theme that changes the background and text colors.
* .bash_profile - Changes the bash prompt to display the Git branch you are currently in.
* .gitconfig - Changes some of the colors displayed when using Git commands.
